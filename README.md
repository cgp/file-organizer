file-organizer
==============

A small pet project of mine to help me create directory structures out of data and meta-data extracted from personal 
images, videos and audio (sometime?). Fills a niche where you want to build a directory structure from the data 
contained within. I will probably add bulk processing for things like facial recognition, out of focus detection, 
and basic tagging. Flexibility will be provided via plugins. 

There will be two modes of operation, GUI and command line. Will generate configuration xml files which can be utilized 
from the command line. 
 
Current Features:

None.

Planned Features:

1. Sort files into a defined tree structure based on EXIF OR date.
2. Utilize a config file which contains the source directories and target directories.
